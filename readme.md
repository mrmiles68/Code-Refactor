Name: Code Refactor

This sample website is an exercise in increasing acessibility for those useing screen readers. ALT commands had to be added to the visual elements to make them appear to screen readers. Also, Semantic HTML commands had to be entered, replacing the use of generic DIV commands so that the formatting and use of the site could be understood by screen readers. These updated semantic commands had to be replicated in the style.css stylesheet so the style commands could still point to the HTML elements. Finally, annotations had to be added to the finished HTML so that others can see how the HTML is logically laid out. 

The included graphics file demonstated the correct appearance of the site.

Since this is not my original code, all upgrades are permitted.
